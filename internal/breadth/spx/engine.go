// from the list become irrelevant to Compute (which iterates over
// members), and names added are picked up by the next Refresh which
// sees them missing from cached and triggers a cold fetch. The
// existing windows for surviving names stay warm — a reconstitution
// of 1-3 names per quarter shouldn't invalidate ~500 cached windows.
//
// New constituents will be excluded from the next Compute pass with
// Reason="thin_history" until their cold-fetch lands and their
// window populates. Per design decision (b) — "pending until 50d
// accrue" — full inclusion in the breadth reading is deferred until
// the new name has 50 trading days of post-inclusion history. Today
// the engine doesn't track per-symbol inclusion dates, so the
// approximation we ship is: the name appears in the exclusion list
// as "thin_history" until its window naturally exceeds WindowSize.
// A follow-up can add per-symbol inclusion dates and the strict
// "exclude for 50d regardless of bar count" semantics.
