// TestReduceSubmitSerializesAgainstConcurrentOrderPlace asserts that the
// discretionary reduce-submit handler holds brokerWriteMu across its whole
// check-then-act, so it cannot interleave with another broker write. Without the
// lock in handleTradeProposalsReduceSubmit the reduce body (preview -> place)
// would run while an order place was mid-flight, reintroducing the double-submit
// TOCTOU the mutex exists to prevent (see server.go). handleTradeProposalsSubmit
// and handleOrderPlace share that same mutex, so an order place stands in here
// for every other broker writer.
//
// The serialization guarantee lives entirely in the handler's Lock(); the reduce
// body itself fails fast at the positions lookup in this harness (no gateway
// connector), which is fine — we are asserting on the lock, not the outcome.
