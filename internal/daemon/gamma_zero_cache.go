// gammaZeroCache holds the current and most-recent zero-gamma compute
// for each scope (combined / SPY / SPX), indexed by NY trading-session
// date. Three concerns intersect here that the existing ttlMap-style
// caches don't handle:
//
//  1. Singleflight per scope. The compute is a multi-minute fan-out
//     across hundreds of option legs against a shared market-data
//     slot pool. Two concurrent callers requesting the SAME scope
//     must share one in-flight job; two concurrent callers requesting
//     DIFFERENT scopes (e.g. combined + --only=spy) must NOT collide
//     on the cache and silently overwrite each other's results.
//
//  2. Background lifetime. The compute outlives any single RPC
//     context — the first caller of the day kicks off a job that the
//     daemon completes regardless of whether the original client
//     hangs around. Subsequent pollers see the in-flight job's
//     progress and pick up the result when it's done.
//
//  3. Scope isolation. The result envelope shape differs across
//     scopes (combined carries PerIndex / RegimeAgreement; SPY-only
//     and SPX-only carry single-underlying-shaped payloads). A
//     scope-mixed cache slot would surface the wrong shape to the
//     wrong caller.
//
// Session key is derived in America/New_York: the result is cached
// for the rest of the same NY trading day and rolls over at midnight
// NY. DST is handled by time.LoadLocation; if the zone fails to load
// the cache falls back to UTC date, which is safe but slightly less
// useful for international callers.
//
// Soft-TTL refresh-while-stale: when a kickOrJoin caller hits a
// cached successful result that's older than the current regular
// option-data session's softTTL (15 min RTH, infinite closed), the
// cache serves the stale value immediately AND kicks a refresh in the
// background. The refresh is stored in the slot's `refresh` field,
// distinct from `current`, so further callers during the refresh keep
// seeing the stable served value rather than blocking on the new
// in-flight job. On completion the refresh promotes to current; on
// error it's discarded so a transient compute failure can't poison a
// known-good cached value.

		//     RTH. E.g. a forced pre-open diagnostic served at 09:31
		//     ET should yield to a regular-session refresh.
		//
		//  2. Age refresh: absolute age exceeds the per-class
		//     softTTL — 15 min in regular option hours.
		//
		// Both triggers are skipped when the current class is
		// SessionClosed: automatic refresh is not expected to improve
		// the signal. softTTL returns math.MaxInt64 for Closed so the
		// age check can never fire there, and the explicit
		// currentClass check below skips the boundary path.
		// retryAllowed also gates this path: once current is past the
		// soft TTL, the trigger condition stays true on every poll while

		// current.startedAt) — the streak gate is what stops that from
