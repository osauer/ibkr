// greeksCache memoises per-option model-computation Greeks so the
// positions handler doesn't churn a fresh option subscription for every
// held leg on every invocation. The keys are the OPRA-style option
// market-data keys (the same shape SubscribeOption returns), so callers
// in handlePositionsList build the same key from the position's contract
// fields and look up directly.
//
// TTL is tuned for actionability — Greeks shift slowly relative to spot
// (delta drifts on the order of minutes for liquid names), and a stale
// cached value is far better than nil for the portfolio-aggregate
// rendering. 60 s strikes the balance: short enough that an aggressive
// `watch -n 60 ibkr positions` re-warms each cycle, long enough that
// back-to-back invocations during a decision pause cost zero gateway
// round trips.
//
// Negative caching is essential. The model-computation tick (msg 21
// tickType 13) silently drops for far-OTM and illiquid OOH legs; we
// still want to remember "we tried and got nothing" so we don't re-
// poll a dead stream on the next call.
//
// Negative entries use a much shorter TTL than positive entries. A
// cold-daemon prewarm commonly fails to receive model ticks within
// the 2.5 s budget — the option-tick pipeline takes a few seconds to
// settle on a fresh connector. Under a single 60 s TTL, that one
// transient miss locked retries out for a full minute, well past the
// point the gateway started delivering ticks. A short negative TTL
// lets the next prewarm re-subscribe and capture the live values
// promptly, while still protecting the gateway from rapid re-poll
// loops within a few seconds.
