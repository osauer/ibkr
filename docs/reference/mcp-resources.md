# MCP resources reference

Last reviewed: 2026-05-24 07:38 CEST

These are the non-tool resources `ibkr mcp` exposes to MCP clients. Tools are documented separately in [MCP tools reference](./mcp-tools.md).

## `ibkr://quote/{symbol}`

Live stock / ETF quote resource.

Use this when an MCP client wants to keep watching one equity or ETF quote without repeatedly calling `ibkr_quote`. The template is discovered through `resources/templates/list`.

Example URI:

```text
ibkr://quote/AAPL
```

`resources/read` returns a one-off quote snapshot with the same JSON shape as `ibkr quote AAPL --json`.

`resources/subscribe` returns `{}` and then streams coalesced tick frames through `notifications/resources/updated` until the client calls `resources/unsubscribe` or closes the MCP session. Notification payloads embed a JSON frame in `params.contents[].text`; the frame shape matches `ibkr quote AAPL --watch --json`.

Only stock and ETF symbols are supported. Option contract streaming is not exposed as an MCP resource today; use `ibkr_chain` or CLI option quotes for option snapshots.
