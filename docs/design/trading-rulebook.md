# Trading Rulebook

Updated: 2026-07-23 07:48 CEST
Status: implemented, advisory, and active as compiled `rulebook-v2`. The
initial 12-rule surface shipped in v1.15.0; the current 14-rule contract folds
in the July 2026 live-market, implementation-review, SQLite-authority, multi-provider
earnings, terminal-evidence, canonical-refresh, and alert-production
amendments described below.

A daily, mechanical 14-rule checklist evaluated daemon-side against the live
book. It is surfaced through CLI, MCP, the Canary SPA, daily-brief deltas,
history, source-neutral alerts, and non-blocking order-preview causes. The
initial heuristic set came from a discretionary-trader review on 2026-07-06;
that provenance and subsequent engineering reviews do not by themselves prove
operator approval of every compiled threshold. The behavioral target is
"hardest trade first", not "most comfortable trade first".

## Why this layer exists

The Rulebook is the desk's **mechanical discipline layer**. It is deliberately
separate from adjacent surfaces:

- Regime and Canary answer whether market stress exists and whether it matters
  to the held portfolio.
- The risk constitution answers whether capital, drawdown, evidence, and
  reconciliation remain inside the operator-approved policy.
- Protection proposals answer which current positions have executable
  reduce-only candidates.
- The Rulebook answers which repeatable operating mistakes are present now:
  concentration, oversized option premium, cash and carry pressure, catalyst
  mismatch, tape-relative weakness, hedge sizing, exit discipline, and
  structural FX exposure.

That distinction is the reason to keep it. A Rulebook row that merely
duplicates another surface, cannot name its current evidence, or has no
repeatable operator response should be removed or redesigned rather than kept
as another warning. Rulebook verdicts remain advisory evidence; they never
authorize or block a broker write.

## Scope

- Goal: encode rules 1–14 (below) as a versioned model evaluated by the
  daemon; advisory-only. The hardest-first ranking is a property of the
  output, not a rule row. Still out of scope after v2: rule 12(b)
  (regime-aware wing-sell preview cause), carried-forward greeks for
  off-session rule-12 evaluability (deferred with a documented morning
  consequence: hedge classification — rule 2's tier, rule 1/13 exemptions —
  needs a live delta, so those tiers only engage once greeks land intraday;
  pre-market the affected legs conservatively take the stricter non-hedge
  path), an fx_exposure act tier + preview cause (watch-only until the TOML
  policy loader ships), and the TOML loader itself.
- User-facing surfaces: `ibkr rules [--json]`, `ibkr rules history`, MCP
  `ibkr_rules`, the SPA Rules card, daily-brief Rulebook deltas,
  source-neutral alert episodes/inbox delivery, and advisory `rule_*` warnings
  on `ibkr order preview`.
- Owner layers: compiled `rulebook-v2` policy (`internal/risk`; an operator
  Rulebook TOML loader remains planned, not shipped), earnings and regime
  state (`daemon.db`), manual earnings overrides + feature toggle (runtime
  platform settings), canonical evaluation and alert lifecycle (daemon), and
  rendering (CLI/MCP/app/SPA adapters, no policy duplication).
- Existing behavior: canary signals already cover margin cushion, gross/net
  exposure, and single-name exposure; proposals already run theta_hygiene
  and risk_reduction buckets. The rulebook does not replace these; it
  presents a fixed 14-rule daily contract on top of the same aggregation.

## Which verdict wins when

Three surfaces measure overlapping metrics with different bars, by design:
the **canary** is regime×portfolio alerting (compiled thresholds, push
alerts), **proposals** are executable protection orders (protection-policy
TOML), and the **rulebook** is a compiled advisory discipline model
(`rulebook-v2`; an operator TOML loader is not shipped). Same
measurements, different questions. Containment so this never drifts into
contradiction:

- One aggregation: rule evaluation consumes the same
  `PositionsPortfolio`/`PositionGroup`/`UnderlyingExposure` values the canary
  reads; a Go test asserts observed values are identical across both
  consumers. Bars may differ; observations may not.
- The compiled Rulebook policy and risk-constitution sibling pin identify
  `rulebook-v2` version 2. The sibling pin currently compares ID/version, not the
  Rulebook fingerprint; it detects version drift but is not threshold-level
  approval provenance. The design cross-references the sibling thresholds
  (canary single-name watch 35 compiled; protection risk-reduction target 25)
  and which surface owns which question. A future operator TOML must preserve
  those disclosures and version/fingerprint semantics.
- Every rendered breach shows observed value next to threshold, so two
  surfaces disagreeing on severity still visibly agree on the number.

## Recorded implementation decisions (not threshold approval)

1. Earnings dates: free web fetch (Nasdaq per-symbol endpoint) + manual
   override; unknown renders as `unknown`, never a false pass.
2. Enforcement: advisory + preview causes. No hard blocks in v1.
3. SPA: compact card on the overview + drill-in. No new tab.
4. Hook: read-only `ibkr orders` allowlisted explicitly (see Agent hook
   boundary).
5. Amendment (2026-07-21): earnings resolution combines Nasdaq with the
   subscription-gated IBKR Wall Street Horizon feed. Provider outcomes remain
   independent; conflicting published dates are `unknown`, and an override is
   still the only operator-authored authority.
6. Amendment (2026-07-21): a reviewed exact broker contract may be classified
   `terminal_non_reporting` from typed daemon.db evidence. This is an explicit
   not-applicable/exempt result for rules 6-8, never a pass and never a
   ticker-wide ignore. A published date, manual override, identity mismatch,
   expired review, or malformed authority fails closed as `unknown`.

These decisions govern evidence handling, advisory enforcement, and surface
placement. They do not establish that the operator approved every numerical
threshold in the compiled model.

## The 14 rules

Inputs available today unless marked otherwise. "Exposure" for a name =
stock shares×spot + Σ(option delta×100×contracts×spot), from
`UnderlyingExposure`/`PositionGroup` aggregation (base currency).
Rules 3/4/12 thresholds are regime-conditional: calm / early_warning /
confirmed sets selected by the latched regime lifecycle stage (see the
regime-conditionality notes).

| # | Rule id | Check | Default threshold | Status when breached |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `single_name_exposure` | per-name exposure / NLV; rule-12-sized short hedge exposure exempt (see notes); provable lower-bound breaches under greeks gaps (see notes) | > 40% | act; watch ≥ 30% |
| 2 | `option_line_premium` | single option line market value / NLV; rule-12-classified hedge legs use the hedge tier | watch ≥ 5%; hedge watch ≥ 15% | act > 10%; hedge act > 25% |
| 3 | `cash_sell_only` | total cash / NLV | < −25 / 0 / +10% by regime | act (advisory "sell-only posture", not an order gate) |
| 4 | `extrinsic_budget` | Σ long-option extrinsic / NLV, excluding rule-12-classified hedge legs (hedge extrinsic disclosed in notes) | watch ≥ 10 / 7.5 / 5% by regime | act > 15 / 12 / 10% by regime |
| 5 | `expiry_runway` | long option DTE < 14 unless ≥70-delta ITM or hedge leg | < 14 DTE | watch; act < 7 DTE |
| 6 | `catalyst_coverage` | OTM long option expiring before the name's next earnings; legs with no underlying spot are named unknowns, never skipped | expiry < earnings | watch |
| 7 | `overwrite_earnings` | short option spanning earnings: short calls act; short puts watch, act on assignment notional (≥ 10% NLV line, ≥ 20% name) | see ET semantics below | act / watch |
| 8 | `earnings_size_freeze` | name ≤3 US sessions from earnings while rule 1 breached on it; greeks-gapped names stay unknown unless earnings provably outside the window | ≤3 sessions | act |
| 9 | `red_on_green` | stock-leg day-change ≤ −1.5% while SPY day-change ≥ +0.5% | intraday only | watch |
| 10 | `winner_trim` | stock-leg day-change ≥ +4% with per-name exposure ≥ 15% NLV | intraday only | watch |
| 11 | `green_day_action` | account daily P&L > 0 while any act-severity rule open | portfolio tape | info (nudge, never act) |
| 12 | `hedge_integrity` | hedge short-delta / gross long delta outside the regime band | 25–35 / 30–50 / 40–70% by regime | watch; act > 2× band top |
| 13 | `exit_discipline` | long option line unrealized loss / premium paid; rule-12-classified hedge legs exempt (decay is the cost of protection) | ≥ 40% | watch; act ≥ 60% |
| 14 | `fx_exposure` | Σ non-base-currency NLV / NLV | ≥ 60% | watch only (see notes) |

Row status enum: `pass | info | watch | act | unknown | not_evaluated`.
`info` renders neutral; it exists so rule 11 never inflates severity. The
five non-pass states are load-bearing: **no input condition may ever
produce `pass` by absence of data.**

Rules 1–8 and 12–13 are portfolio-discipline controls in this advisory model.
Rules 9–10 are tactical tape heuristics, rule 11 is a behavioral nudge, and
rule 14 is a structural visibility condition. None is an enforced risk-policy
limit; rule 3's sell-only wording describes a posture, not a broker control.

Semantics notes:

- Ranking (hardest-first; the number 13 was reassigned to exit_discipline
  in v2): estimated exposure impact descending where the rule has a natural
  impact (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13 = offending exposure, premium, or
  salvageable premium in base currency); rules 3, 9, 11, 14 rank by
  severity then rule number. Impact definition lives beside each rule in
  the policy file.
- Hedge legs (rules 1, 5, 12): long puts on a policy-owned index list (default
  `SPY, SPX, SPXW, QQQ, IWM`). Classification is disclosed per leg in the
  result; rule 5 lists which legs it exempted; while rule 12's band is
  breached high (over-hedged) the rule-5 hedge exemption is suppressed so a
  misclassified directional put resurfaces. Short index puts have positive
  delta and are never classified hedge.
- Rule 1 hedge exemption (post-ship amendments, 2026-07-07, from the first
  live-market run): a policy-hedge index name carrying net-short delta is
  the hedge, not concentration — rule 12 owns its sizing, and ranking the same
  hedge again here can bury the actual single-name offenders. The exemption
  covers only what rule 12 can actually size: legs passing the shared
  `rule12HedgeLeg` predicate (long put on a hedge-listed underlying with
  delta and underlying present), capped at the name's net-short exposure,
  disclosed in the row's Exempt list with a rule-12 pointer — never
  silently dropped. Residual short beyond the sized legs stays a
  concentration offender, and a hedge-symbol short with no sizeable legs
  (short stock, short calls) gets no Exempt row at all — it ranks as
  ordinary concentration. Long index exposure is always ordinary
  concentration. Unlike rule 5, this exemption is not suppressed while
  rule 12 is over-band: the oversized short is exactly what rule 12 flags,
  and double-counting it as concentration was the original failure mode.
- Rules 9/10 evaluate only during the US equity session
  (`marketcal.SessionAt`) and only from existing stock-leg quote enrichment
  (`DayChangePct`) plus one dedicated best-effort SPY snapshot quote per
  evaluation (`spyDayChangePct`, 2.5s budget; correction 2026-07-08 — the
  implementation never read the regime snapshot's SPY tape). **No standing
  market-data subscriptions** (100-slot budget). Option-only names:
  `not_evaluated` with reason `no_stock_leg_tape`. Off-session:
  `not_evaluated`.
- Daily P&L is part of account-source health for rule 11. During the US equity
  regular session, missing, malformed, or stale Daily P&L degrades account
  health and fails portfolio-dependent rows closed. Outside that session,
  absence is typed `not_due`; the other rules continue on complete
  account/position evidence and rule 11 alone is
  `not_evaluated/pnl_unavailable`.
- Rules 6/7/8 report `unknown` when the earnings date is unknown or stale
  (staleness threshold in policy). Provider-flagged estimated dates
  evaluate normally but evidence discloses `estimated`. Manual overrides win
  over ordinary provider resolution, but neither an override nor a published
  provider date may silently displace exact-contract terminal authority: that
  disagreement is `conflicting_sources`, with neither a usable date nor a
  terminal exemption. Comparisons are computed in ET with `time_of_day`: AMC
  earnings on an option's expiry day do NOT breach rule 7 (the option dies
  before the gap); BMO earnings count the prior session as last runway day;
  unknown `time_of_day` is conservative (flag, with ambiguity disclosed).
  Rule 8 counts US sessions via `marketcal`, not calendar days.
- A `terminal_non_reporting` input is available only when the held stock's
  positive IBKR ConID, symbol, and `STK` type all match one reviewed authority
  record. The affected name is listed in each relevant row's `Exempt` array;
  when every relevant name is terminal, the row is `not_evaluated` with reason
  `terminal_non_reporting`, never `pass`. Ticker reuse or a different listing
  receives ordinary provider resolution. The typed earnings projection carries
  the SQLite revision, a normalized-record SHA-256 fingerprint, effective and
  verification timestamps, the mandatory review deadline, and allowlisted
  primary-source references. A stock-only terminal holding is an explicit
  Exempt/not-applicable row. If the same symbol group also contains options,
  the stock record cannot exempt them because the portfolio projection does
  not carry each option's exact underlying ConID; those legs use ordinary
  provider resolution or remain unknown. Other held names in the same snapshot
  remain assessed normally. An expired,
  stale, identity-conflicted, or date-conflicted exact terminal record is
  likewise recognized before option-side or size relevance in rules 6-8, but
  fails closed as `unknown` with no exemption, including for a stock-only name.
- Greeks gaps (rules 1, 4, 12): a leg with material notional (≥ policy
  floor, default 1% NLV) missing delta makes that name's rule-1/12 row
  `unknown` naming the leg; rule 4 goes `unknown` when uncomputable
  extrinsic exceeds the same floor. Mirrors the proposal engine's
  `extrinsic_uncomputable` rigor — never a silent skip.
- Every rule row carries: id, title, status, observed, threshold, evidence,
  per-name offenders (worst first), exempted/unknown legs where relevant,
  and data-quality notes.

Rulebook v2 implementation-review findings (2026-07-08, trading-semantics
and Go-implementation lenses; engineering review, not operator policy
approval):

- **Partial data may indict, never acquit.** Rule 1 computes a provable
  per-name minimum when material legs miss delta: known legs are already in
  `ExposureBase`; each delta-less leg contributes a signed interval (long
  call: intrinsic…notional, since delta·S ≥ C ≥ intrinsic; long put:
  −notional…0 — put intrinsic is NOT a bound on |delta·S| and is never
  used; shorts mirrored; missing underlying or FX ⇒ unbounded). A breach is
  asserted only when the interval minimum alone crosses the bar, rendered
  "≥ X%" with `observed_is_lower_bound`; anything short of provable stays
  `unknown`.
- **Regime conditionality (rules 3/4/12).** The daemon latches the regime
  lifecycle stage on every regime snapshot, buckets it (quiet/opportunity →
  calm; early_warning/stabilization → early_warning; confirmed_stress/
  panic/forced_defense → confirmed; data_quality holds the previous latch;
  unrecognized future stages take the MIDDLE bucket, never silently calm)
  and persists it as a versioned daemon.db state document so a restart
  mid-stress cannot reset thresholds to calm. Stage older than
  `regime_stage_max_age_minutes` (default 240) serves as *carried*: the
  rule evaluates under BOTH the carried set and the calm set and reports
  the worse verdict — stale regime data can hold or tighten, never relax,
  in either band direction (a stale "confirmed" hedge band is wider than
  calm and would otherwise acquit). A cold or stale latch kicks one async
  regime refresh (single-flight, 10-minute cooldown, never from the
  preview path). Row notes always disclose which set applied and why.
- **Rule 2 hedge tier + rule 12 act tier are an atomic pair.** Hedge-
  classified legs (`rule12HedgeLeg`) measure against 15/25% of NLV; the
  oversized-hedge act moves to rule 12 at >2× the band top. Shipping one
  without the other leaves an oversized hedge with no act anywhere. The
  rule-12 act evidence states explicitly: the flag is sizing honesty ("a
  directional short wearing a hedge's clothing"), not a directive to get
  long during stress. Unclassifiable legs (no live delta) take the normal
  tier — no relief without classification.
- **Rule 13 exit_discipline** fences long-option losses at −40/−60% of
  premium paid (cost basis = multiplier-inclusive AvgCost × |contracts| ×
  FX — never re-multiplied). Hedge legs are exempt: a decayed hedge's
  problem is lost protection, which rule 12's under-band arm catches as
  deltas shrink, not lost premium. Averaging down resets the basis and
  clears the fence — documented deliberately; the order-preview cause on
  adding to a flagged line is the guard.
- **Rule 14 fx_exposure is watch-only in v2.** On a structurally high
  non-base-currency book, a permanent act and
  an every-USD-order preview cause would be pure alarm fatigue — a warning
  with a 100% base rate trains the operator to ignore `rule_*` causes.
  Never-false-pass corroboration: an empty `CurrencyExposure` report only
  passes as "base-only" when the positions snapshot shows no non-base leg
  and no FX sensitivity; otherwise the row is `unknown` (`fx_unavailable`).
- **Stock-leg underlying join.** An option leg whose greeks tick carried no
  underlying spot borrows the same-name stock leg's account mark
  (`UnderlyingSource: stock_leg_mark`; quality-gated `Mark > 0 && !Stale`),
  making rules 4/6 evaluable pre-market for stock-backed names. Derived
  spots support OTM-ness and extrinsic; they never classify hedge legs —
  pairing a greeks-tick delta with a different-source spot is exactly the
  apples-and-oranges sizing the join exists to avoid.

## Input health (result-level gate)

`RulesResult.InputHealth` mirrors the canary's source-health pattern: one
entry per source (account, positions, regime_stage, earnings, tape) with
status/as_of/reason. When positions or account are pending, stale, or absent
— boot races included — every portfolio-dependent row is `unknown` with the
source reason. A cold daemon renders a column of `unknown`, never 14 green
rows. Positions health is bound to the completed portfolio-stream receipt for
the current broker account, not the age of a locally assembled response: an
unprimed, wrong-account, future-dated, or more-than-five-minute-silent stream is
pending/unavailable/stale and cannot clear a Rulebook alert episode. This is
the acceptance criterion for the property test below. Alert recovery also
requires the exact 14 rule IDs with their canonical numbers and exactly those
five health sources. Missing, extra, duplicate, or unknown rows stay
uncovered. `not_evaluated` is a trusted negative only for reviewed terminal
evidence on rules 6–8, off-session tape on rules 9–10, or no long book on rule
12; every other reason retains the prior episode.

```

- **Placement:** Canary and Rulebook share pure evaluators but remain separate
  typed results. The daemon now runs the canonical Canary and Rulebook
  cadences; CLI/MCP/app readers reuse those daemon-owned inputs and contracts.
  Rules do not attach to `CanaryResult`: `rules.snapshot` remains a sibling
  section of the app live snapshot (`Rules *rpc.RulesResult` beside
  `Canary`), riding the existing SSE event.
- The pure Rulebook evaluator is stateless and lives in `internal/risk` with
  table tests. Production evaluation is daemon-owned: a complete canonical
  evaluation runs every minute independently of the app, and interactive
  readers may publish an earlier result through the same single-flight path.
- **Earnings fetches are strictly off the snapshot path.** `rules.snapshot`
  only observes cache state and kicks an async refresher: bounded concurrency
  (≤4), an 8s provider budget, and durable per-provider outcome/backoff state.
  Transport failure alone may retain a last-good date as stale; an explicit
  no-date, unsupported-security, schema change, or provider conflict cannot
  hide behind LKG. Nasdaq endpoint spike (2026-07-07, empirical):
  `Go-http-client/1.1` is reset at connection level by api.nasdaq.com
  (exit 000 in 0.17s); a browser-identifying UA with `Accept:
  application/json` returns 200 in ~2–3s. The fetcher therefore sends a
  browser-style UA — a deliberate, documented choice, not the spx-fetcher
  convention. Both provider parsers are strict; any ambiguity becomes a typed
  unknown plus source degradation, never a guessed date. Nasdaq symbol mapping
  is an explicit tested function (IBKR `BRK B` → Nasdaq `BRK.B`). IBKR WSH is
  requested through serialized metadata/event reads and requires the account's
  WSH research entitlement. Matching dates form consensus; differing dates or
  incompatible published session halves remain `conflicting_sources`.
- Persistence: daemon.db v2 current state plus immutable provider-outcome
  observations. Each symbol stores aggregate resolution and per-provider
  latest attempt, next retry, typed redacted failure, and last-good value.
  State and outcome observations commit atomically before memory publication;
  the provider fresh window is 24h and the retained-date TTL is 45d.
  Manual override `features.rulebook.earnings_overrides` (map sym →
  YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTamc/bmo, `null` clears) wins over fetch;
  platform-settings contract (access/source/reason) applies.
- Terminal evidence is a separate daemon.db v1 state document under the
  earnings authority. `[rulebook].terminal_evidence_file` optionally names a
  private operator JSON file used only as a startup import/update; snapshots
  never read the file and SQLite remains the sole served authority. The file
  must be a regular `0600` file, use the closed schema below, bind positive
  ConID + symbol + `STK`, and contain at least two independent allowlisted
  primary authorities. CIK is optional; when supplied it must be ten digits
  and not all zero, and an SEC filing reference requires a matching CIK. No
  SEC reference is otherwise mandatory. Unknown fields, unsafe URLs, future
  verification, duplicate ConIDs, an older catalog `reviewed_at`, changed catalog content at
  the same review time, or a changed/older record without a newer
  `verified_at` fail daemon startup. `reviewed_at` and `verified_at` may not be
  later than the daemon's validation clock; there is no future-clock grace.
  Each removed ConID creates a daemon-owned tombstone at that import's
  `reviewed_at`. Operator files cannot author or erase tombstones. Reactivating
  that exact ConID requires record evidence whose `verified_at` is strictly
  later than the retained revocation watermark, so neither the exact old file
  nor its old record under a newly bumped wrapper can resurrect authority.
  Tombstones remain in SQLite after legitimate reactivation. Omitting the
  config path retains the committed SQLite revision; importing an empty
  `contracts` array with a newer `reviewed_at` explicitly revokes all active
  records.
  The maximum 366-day interval from `verified_at` to
  `revalidate_after` is evidence-expiry safety, not an alert or trading-policy
  threshold. At the deadline the record remains visible but rules degrade to
  unknown until a newer review advances the SQLite revision.

  ```
- Every initialize/import/update/revoke revision atomically couples the current
  state document to one immutable typed observation. Its payload records the
  old/new revision, normalized catalog fingerprints and review times, plus
  sorted per-ConID `added`, `updated`, `revoked`, or `reactivated`
  dispositions with record fingerprints and any revocation watermark. It
  contains no issuer, symbol, evidence URL, or operator prose. This authority
  history reconstructs the revision/fingerprint and contract-disposition chain;
  rule-transition events separately identify evaluation changes.
- **Canonical cache and preview causes:** daemon, CLI, app, and preview readers
  reuse a broker-scope-, connector-, and connector-generation-bound result for
  up to 75 seconds. An expired preview read performs a bounded canonical
  evaluation; contention or interruption returns an explicit
  `rulebook_unavailable` advisory instead of silently dropping warnings. When
  a drafted order would worsen a currently breached rule (increase the
  breached metric; reduce/close never warns), it appends
  `DataWarning{Code: "rule_<id>", Severity: <the rule's own watch|act>,
  Scope: "rulebook"}`. The Rulebook as-of time is disclosed in the warning's
  `Impact` prose; `DataWarning` has no separate `rules_as_of` field. No ninth
  severity word; `submit_eligible` is never affected.
- Policy: embedded default `rulebook-v2` (Version 2; every threshold —
  including the three regime sets — is part of `FingerprintKey`, so a
  threshold outside the fingerprint is impossible without failing the
  fingerprint test). The optional operator TOML override
  (`~/.config/ibkr/policies/rulebook-policy.toml`, protection-policy
  manager semantics, 30s reload) is **planned, not shipped** — v1 doc
  described it aspirationally; corrected 2026-07-08. Until it lands,
  threshold changes are code changes.
- Evidence: rule-status transitions append as typed analytical events to the
  daemon's sole live database, `~/.local/state/ibkr/daemon.db`, so threshold
  calibration can use the observations that landed. Transition history is
  best-effort observability, not policy-critical continuity: an append failure
  is logged and can leave a gap without suppressing the current canonical
  result. It therefore cannot prove post-trade adherence or broker causality.
  Every transition payload also carries a sorted,
  deduplicated `terminal_authorities` list for the exact terminal evidence the
  evaluation accepted: contract ConID, authority revision and fingerprint,
  review/verification/revalidation times, and classification only. The field
  is an explicit empty list when none was accepted, and never contains issuer
  or symbol text, CIK, URLs, evidence prose, expired evidence, or conflicting
  authority. The latched regime bucket is a versioned state document in the
  same database. Retired JSON/JSONL paths exist only as one-time cutover
  inputs and isolated test seams.
- Alerts: the daemon maps complete, unfiltered Rulebook snapshots into the
  source-neutral alert authority. Current watch/act rows open or escalate
  episodes; only a current, complete, account/positions-bound negative can
  recover them. The app owns inbox, unread, delivery attempts, receipts, and
  fixed presentation copy; neither side gains broker-write authority.
- Settings: `features.rulebook.enabled` (default true, runtime) gates
  canonical evaluation, alert production, the SPA card, and preview causes;
  disabled leaves `ibkr rules` readable with `status: disabled`
  (stock_protection pattern). This is a product feature toggle, not a
  rule-scoped policy exception, threshold approval, or broker-write control.

## Authority

| Concept | Authoritative source | Typed field/contract | Renderer/tool | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rule thresholds | compiled Rulebook model (operator TOML planned) × latched regime stage for rules 3/4/12 | `RulesResult.PolicyFingerprint` | all | embedded `rulebook-v2`; sibling ID/version pin is not fingerprint-level approval; stage carried/never-seen ⇒ worse-of/calm with disclosure |
| Rule verdicts | daemon canonical evaluation + `rules.snapshot` | `RulesResult.Rules []RuleRow` | CLI/MCP/SPA, brief delta, history | per-row `unknown`/`not_evaluated`, result-level InputHealth |
| Earnings dates/applicability | daemon multi-provider earnings resolution ∪ authoritative override ∪ exact-contract SQLite terminal evidence | `RulesResult.Earnings[]` with provider outcomes, terminal revision/fingerprint/provenance | same | typed `unknown`; conflicts/expired evidence have no usable date or exemption; stale LKG flagged |
| Preview causes | daemon preview handler (scope-bound canonical result ≤75s) | `Warnings[].Code = rule_*`, `Scope = rulebook`; as-of in `Impact` | order preview surfaces | explicit unavailable advisory when canonical read cannot complete |
| Alert episodes | daemon source-neutral alert authority | complete `RulesResult` + typed episode/occurrence contracts | Alerts inbox and Web Push | stale/incomplete evidence cannot clear an episode |
| Feature toggle + overrides | platform settings (runtime) | `features.rulebook.*` | settings surfaces + SPA | defaults on |

## SPA (authority-matrix row)

| UI concept | Label | Source | Snapshot path | Fixture/test | Stale/error | QA gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rules card | "Rules" | live snapshot sibling section | `snapshot.rules` | browser_script_ids_test + app-browser-smoke | worst 2–3 breaches as tone pills; `unknown` neutral; InputHealth degradation shows as card-level note; card hidden when disabled | `make app-check` + `make app-refresh-smoke` |

Card: `#canaryRulesCard` beside the canary hero (worst 2–3 breaches as
severity pills, ranked hardest-first) + `#canaryRulesToggle` expanding
`#canaryRulesDetailPanel` with the full 14-row `.detail-grid` (tone classes
`risk|warn|ok|neutral`; `info` and `unknown` render neutral). Each breach
card shows observed vs threshold. Money strings arrive daemon-rendered with
real currency (the compat test bans a `"USD"` literal in app.js). Read-only.

## Safety invariants (unchanged)

- Advisory only: no rulebook state may alter `submit_eligible`, blockers,
  freeze, pins, tokens, or any gated broker-write path.
- Nil means unavailable; unknown earnings ≠ pass; off-session tape rules are
  `not_evaluated`; absent inputs are `unknown`. Never false pass.
- `as_of`, InputHealth, and policy fingerprint ride every result.
- MCP description states when to invoke (daily review, "what should I fix
  today") and when not (`ibkr_canary` for regime×portfolio alerting,
  `ibkr_proposals` for executable protection orders).

## Agent hook boundary

The broker hook explicitly allowlists Rulebook and other read-only
investigations while keeping broker writes, settings writes, and destructive
maintenance on their separate gated paths. The table-driven
`hooks/ibkr-pre-tool-use_test.sh` is wired into `make check` and covers both
false-block and false-allow directions. Hook deployment/version history is not
part of the Rulebook semantic contract.

## Verification

- **Never-false-pass property test** (acceptance for the safety invariant):
  for every rule, nil each input dimension — positions empty/pending,
  account absent, greeks stripped, earnings unknown, off-session, per-leg
  underlying stripped with healthy positions (the rule-6 live false pass of
  2026-07-08), FX report absent, cost bases missing — and assert
  `unknown`/`not_evaluated`, never `pass`.
- v2 unit coverage: regime-set selection incl. carried worse-of in both
  band directions and never-seen disclosure; rule 2 tier split incl.
  unclassifiable fallback; rule 7 short-put notional tiers incl. unknown-FX
  no-quiet-escalation; rule 8 gap propagation (unknown/near/provably-out);
  rule 1 lower-bound direction-awareness (long-put blocks the bound);
  exit-discipline fences + hedge exemption; fingerprint mutation coverage
  for every new policy field.
- Unit: `internal/risk` table tests per rule (pass/info/watch/act/unknown/
  not_evaluated, hedge classification incl. suppression, rule-1 hedge
  exemption incl. residual and no-sizeable-legs cases, ranking, greeks
  floors); hoisted option-math helpers keep proposal-engine tests green.
- Doc drift: `internal/risk` tests pin the rule-1 hedge-exemption wording,
  canonical one-minute/75-second freshness contract, compiled-policy
  authority, rule-14 boundary, and top-level discoverability links. A semantic
  or ownership change therefore fails the hermetic suite until the design and
  navigation move with it.
- Earnings: recorded-fixture parse tests (normal, estimated, malformed,
  missing-date, human-format dates); symbol-normalization tests (BRK.B,
  EUR names → unsupported); ET/DST table tests (BMO Monday after Friday
  expiry, AMC on expiry day, DST boundary week); cache
  load/save/TTL/override-precedence; refresher backoff + failure memory.
- Terminal evidence: strict JSON/URL/permission and no-future-time validation;
  exact ConID identity including ticker-reuse rejection; SQLite restart
  continuity and revision/fingerprint projection; per-ConID tombstone
  anti-rollback covering exact-old and bumped-wrapper resurrection attempts;
  legitimate newly verified reactivation; atomic immutable authority-change
  observations; provider/date and override conflict; expiry degradation; pure
  rules (including stock-only terminal names) assert exempt or `not_evaluated`,
  never pass.
- Aggregation-consistency drift test: canary concentration and rule 1 read
  identical exposure values (review finding 6a).
- Portfolio receipt gate: current completed empty snapshot is a trustworthy
  negative; stale silence and account changes stay uncovered and retain active
  Rulebook episodes; a later current scoped negative may recover them.
- Preview causes: worsen logic incl. reduce/close exemption; TTL staleness;
  severity vocabulary unchanged (no new words).
- Contract: CLI JSON preservation test; generic CLI↔MCP command parity;
  Rulebook MCP provenance-description test; SQLite Rulebook-history
  round-trip; `make docs-regen` for generated MCP and public HTML references.
- SPA: browser_script_ids_test additions; app-browser-smoke exercises card,
  drill-in, and InputHealth-degraded rendering.
- Live gate: full `make smoke` + before/after artifacts per the
  daemon-cli-trading-contract template: `ibkr status --json`, `ibkr rules
  --json` against the live book, `ibkr order preview … --json` showing a
  `rule_*` warning, SPA rendered-flow screenshot.

## Rollback

- Revert files above; runtime state added: daemon.db earnings/settings/latch
  documents (including terminal evidence and retained per-ConID revocation
  tombstones), immutable earnings/provider and terminal-authority change
  observations, and rule-transition events. A rollback may ignore the rulebook
  records, but must not delete or replace daemon.db. To revoke terminal evidence
  before a code rollback, import a reviewed empty v1 document and verify its
  advanced SQLite revision; removing the import path alone deliberately retains
  authority.
- User-visible on rollback: the rules card, current `ibkr rules` result,
  advisory `rule_*` preview warnings, new Rulebook alert production, and new
  brief state deltas disappear. Retained history/evidence is not deleted; no
  trading-path change occurs either way.
