# Risk Regime Dashboard Contract

**Updated:** 2026-07-19 23:01 CEST

`ibkr regime` reports the broad-market stress lifecycle: `quiet`,
`early_warning`, `confirmed_stress`, `panic`, `stabilization`, `opportunity`,
or `data_quality`. It is an evidence-balance read, not a prediction, trading
system, portfolio planner, or investment recommendation.

Use it to answer one question: are several independent market-risk indicators
confirming each other, or is the market still broadly calm?

Canary may consume this output, but canary owns account and portfolio action. A
portfolio concentration problem can be real even while the broad market regime
is calm.

## Output Shape

Each row should show:

- current value;
- band: `green`, `yellow`, `red`, or unranked;
- status: `ok`, `stale`, `computing`, `unavailable`, or `error`;
- source and as-of information;
- a short band reason;
- the threshold set used for that row.

The top-level envelope should also show:

- `lifecycle`: scope (`market` for regime), stage, severity, readiness, timing, confidence, evidence,
  confirmed sources, unconfirmed sources, a semantic lifecycle fingerprint, and
  an explicit no-execution statement;
- `source_health`: per-cluster `as_of`, status, age/freshness, confidence, and
  fingerprint-stability semantics;
- `fingerprint`: semantic identity for the classified broad-market state.

Missing, stale, computing, and degraded data must stay visible. A quiet reading
with missing critical inputs is not the same thing as a confirmed calm regime.

## Indicator Sources

Each row must identify the concrete data source and actual symbol or series
behind the reading. The live dashboard uses these sources; historical replays
may substitute point-in-time equivalents, but the row meaning should stay the
same.

| Row | Actual symbols or series | Live source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VIX/VIX3M | `VIX` and `VIX3M`, Cboe equity-volatility indexes | IBKR index market data for Cboe VIX and VIX3M; backtests use Cboe official historical CSVs. |
| VVIX | `VVIX`, Cboe's VIX-of-VIX index | Cboe official daily VVIX time series. |
| HYG/SPY | `HYG`, a high-yield corporate bond ETF, and `SPY`, an S&P 500 ETF | IBKR HYG/SPY quotes plus HMDS daily bars; SPY 52-week high uses IBKR Misc Stats tick 165 when available and daily-bar fallback otherwise. Backtests use Nasdaq public ETF history. |
| HY OAS | FRED `BAMLH0A0HYM2` for high-yield OAS and `BAMLC0A0CM` for investment-grade corporate OAS | FRED/St. Louis Fed CSVs for ICE BofA option-adjusted spread series. |
| CP 90-day AA financial minus 13-week T-bill | Federal Reserve `RIFSPPFAAD90_N.B` and U.S. Treasury `ROUND_B1_CLOSE_13WK_2`; cached under legacy series keys `RIFSPPFAAD90NB` / `DTB3` for wire compatibility | Federal Reserve Commercial Paper Data Download Program plus U.S. Treasury Daily Treasury Bill Rates. |
| USD/JPY weekly change | `USD.JPY`, routed as IBKR `CASH` on `IDEALPRO` with currency `JPY` | IBKR FX tick plus HMDS midpoint history for the seven-trading-day comparison; Tier 1 historical replay uses FRED `DEXJPUS`. |
| SPX-canonical dealer gamma | `SPX`/`SPXW` index options with `SPY` ETF options as context | IBKR option chains, open interest, option quotes/model-computation ticks, and the daemon's gamma cache. |
| S&P 500 breadth | Current S&P 500 constituent stock tickers; there is no single breadth symbol used live | Local daemon compute from IBKR HMDS constituent daily bars and the generated S&P 500 membership list. |

## Clusters

A cluster is a group of related indicators. The composite regime counts
clusters, not raw rows, so one market theme cannot vote twice.

Within each cluster, the worst ranked row wins: red beats yellow, yellow beats
green. Unavailable, computing, and error rows are unranked.

### Equity Volatility

This cluster watches option-market fear. VIX/VIX3M asks whether near-term fear
is priced above longer-term fear. VVIX asks whether traders are paying up for
large volatility moves. When both worsen, equity stress is usually becoming
more urgent.

VIX is Cboe's 30-day implied-volatility index for the S&P 500. VIX3M is the
same idea over roughly three months, and VVIX measures how volatile VIX itself
is expected to be.

VIX/VIX3M backwardation is stress-level evidence by itself. An isolated VVIX
red between 110 and 120 is noisier: the VVIX row remains red and visible, but
the equity-volatility cluster counts as yellow unless VVIX is at least 120, VIX
is up at least 20% on the day, SPY is down at least 1% on the day, or another
independent cluster is red. This keeps volatility warnings visible without
letting a standalone vol-of-vol pop dominate the broad-market read.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VIX/VIX3M | < 0.92 | 0.92-1.00 | > 1.00 |
| VVIX | < 90 | 90-110 | > 110 |

### Credit

This cluster watches whether corporate credit is weakening before or alongside
stocks. HYG is an ETF holding high-yield corporate bonds, meaning lower-rated
company debt that behaves more like risk assets than Treasuries. SPY is the
large S&P 500 ETF used here as the stock-market comparison.

HYG/SPY is the faster market proxy. HY/IG OAS is the slower official cash-credit
read: it compares high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond spreads, where
OAS means the extra yield investors demand over Treasuries after adjusting for
bond options. Credit stress matters because equity rallies are less sturdy when
lenders are already demanding more compensation for risk.

HYG/SPY can still show a red row by itself. For the cluster count, that
single proxy red is treated as a yellow watch unless cash credit is also red or
another independent cluster is red. The row stays visible; it just does not get
to call broad stress alone.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HYG/SPY | HYG healthy | HYG below 50-DMA | HYG weak while SPY is near highs |
| HY OAS | < 4.0 and not widening | 4.0-5.5 or widening > 0.50 pp | > 5.5 or widening > 1.00 pp |

### Funding

This cluster watches whether short-term money markets are becoming stressed.
The spread between 90-day AA financial commercial paper and 3-month T-bills is
a simple check on whether financial borrowers are paying unusually high short-
term funding costs.

Commercial paper is short-term company borrowing; T-bills are short-term U.S.
Treasury borrowing. A wider spread means financial firms are paying noticeably
more than the government to borrow for a similar short horizon.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CP 90-day AA financial minus 3-month T-bill | < 25 bp | 25-75 bp | > 75 bp |

### FX Carry

This cluster watches USD/JPY as a proxy for global carry-trade pressure. When
the yen strengthens quickly, leveraged risk trades can unwind at the same time.
That does not predict every selloff, but it is useful confirmation when other
clusters are also deteriorating.

USD/JPY is quoted as yen per U.S. dollar. A falling USD/JPY means the yen is
strengthening, which is the direction that can pressure yen-funded carry trades.

USD/JPY can still show a red row by itself. For the cluster count, an isolated
FX red is treated as a yellow watch until another independent cluster confirms
stress. Canary may still act on a fast carry unwind when direct SPY/VIX tape or
breadth confirms the move. On official non-trading dates (weekend or holiday)
frozen last-session SPY/VIX prints cannot supply that tape confirmation — in
the canary only the breadth arm can, until live prints return at the next
open, and the canary's direct tape-shock row demotes to observe with
confirm-at-next-open guidance.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USD/JPY weekly change | yen move < 1% | yen strengthens 1-2% | yen strengthens > 2% |

### Dealer Gamma

This cluster watches whether dealer hedging is more likely to dampen or amplify
index moves. Above zero-gamma, hedging flows are usually more stabilizing.
Below zero-gamma, hedging can chase the market lower or higher and make moves
sharper. Treat this as a regime hint, not a precise tradable level.

SPX/SPXW index options are the canonical production signal for S&P 500 dealer
gamma. SPY is the exchange-traded S&P 500 ETF; its option book trades
separately and is used as corroborating context when fresh and high quality.
Missing or throttled SPY does not downgrade an otherwise fresh, rankable SPX
gamma result. SPY-only gamma is a proxy, not the canonical S&P dealer-gamma row.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SPX zero-gamma | spot > 2% above zero-gamma | within +/-2% | spot below zero-gamma |

Gamma is ranked only when `gamma_zero.envelope.result.quality.rankability` is
`rankable`. Non-rankable gamma remains visible in the row/envelope, but it does
not become the active gamma market-structure read:

| Rankability | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rankable` | Fresh and covered enough to treat as the active market-structure signal. Rankable SPX is stable and production-ready even when SPY is unavailable and disclosed as context. |
| `context_only` | Awareness-only market-structure context. |
| `blocked` | Payload exists but a freshness, coverage, OI, model, cache, farm, entitlement, pacing, or partial-chain gate blocks ranking. |
| `unavailable` | No usable OI-weighted gamma payload exists. |

Missing 0DTE is disclosed in the horizon coverage and warning details, but it
does not by itself make an otherwise healthy SPX read context-only when the
1-7DTE and term buckets are present. After the expiring SPXW series closes, the
0DTE bucket can be absent while the broader SPX surface remains usable.

Model-quality gates judge per slice, never pooled. Each underlying's
derived-IV share, top-strike concentration, and median per-expiry skew-fit R²
are judged on that underlying's own slice. The skew bars are preferred ≥ 0.75
SPX, ≥ 0.70 SPY, with a hard block below 0.50; a median between the block and
preferred bars still ranks, with the gate's reason disclosing the
sub-preferred fit: median R² is amplitude-relative and tracks intraday smile
noise rather than coverage health, so it is disclosure-worthy but not
rank-blocking on its own. The combined node carries no pooled model gates:
the pooled derived-IV share is leg-count weighted across both chains and the
cross-book concentration ratio matches no per-slice calibration, so gating
them there would let a present-but-degraded SPY downgrade a rankable SPX (the
same posture violation as the absent-SPY rule above forbids). The pooled
numbers stay visible in `quality.coverage` as diagnostics, and the SPX
slice's own verdict reaches the combined node through the `spx_coverage`
gate. One consequence: a SPY slice ranking inside the disclosed skew window
votes in the combined band weighting. Every successful compute appends
per-slice skew diagnostics (per-expiry R² and residual RMS, coverage,
rankability) to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ibkr/gamma-skew-diagnostics.jsonl`, offline
calibration input for these heuristic bars; nothing reads it at runtime and
it is safe to delete.

### Breadth

This cluster watches how many S&P 500 stocks are participating. A rally led by
many stocks is healthier than a rally carried by a few mega-caps. Weak breadth
near index highs warns that the headline index may be hiding fragility.

There is no single live IBKR symbol for this row. The daemon computes it from
daily bars for the individual S&P 500 member stocks and caches the post-close
result.

| Row | Green | Yellow | Red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S&P 500 breadth | > 55% above 50-DMA | 40-55%, or weakening near highs | < 40%, especially while SPX is near highs |

## Confirmation Eligibility and Severity Governance

A red row may CONFIRM stress only when its evidence is deep, persistent, and
cadence-fresh. Otherwise it is PROVISIONAL: visible on the row, listed in
`lifecycle.unconfirmed`, able to drive `early_warning`, but it never counts
toward `confirmed_stress`/`panic`, never rescues another cluster from its
isolated-red downgrade, and never reaches `confirmed_by`. This policy exists
because of the 2026-06-12 false positive, where a 7 bps HYG break (one session
old, thin pre-open tick) and a prior-evening gamma cache mutually confirmed
"Broad stress regime / act" against a green tape
(docs/design/regime-calibration.md).

Eligibility gates per indicator (heuristic noise floors, pending_backtest like
the band thresholds; values live in `internal/rpc/regime_policy.go`):

| Indicator | Min depth for eligible red | Fast path (eligible day 1) | Min streak (NY trading sessions) | Cadence freshness | Exit hysteresis (leave red) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VIX/VIX3M | ratio >= 1.00 | ratio >= 1.05 | 2 | same-session tick | ratio < 0.98 |
| VVIX | >= 110 | >= 120 | 2 | latest official daily close (<= 4d) | < 105 |
| HYG/SPY | HYG >= 0.25% below 50DMA | >= 1.0% below | 2 | RTH tick or latest official close (off-hours banding input is the close, never a thin pre/post print; a missing spot tick falls back to the close and marks the row stale) | HYG closes back above 50DMA |
| HY OAS | band is the gate | n/a | 1 | series <= 7d | < 5.25 and widening < 0.85 pp |
| Funding | band is the gate | n/a | 1 | series <= 7d | < 65 bp |
| USD/JPY | band is the gate (speed is depth) | n/a | 1 | same-day tick/close | yen move < 1.5% |
| Dealer gamma | gap <= -0.5% below gamma-zero | gap <= -2.0% or wholly-short profile | 1 | compute within current NY trading date (prior-date cache = `stale`, warns only) | gap > +0.5% |
| Breadth | <= 38% | <= 30% | 2 | last completed session's compute | > 45% |

Eligibility latches for the life of the red streak (a depth wobble back inside
the floor does not flip it); freshness is never latched: overdue data drops
eligibility immediately. Streaks count NY trading days; a weekend or holiday
poll keys to the most recent trading day.

Severity governance, applied after stage selection and disclosed in
`lifecycle.governors[]`:

1. While a confirming cluster's threshold set carries `pending_backtest`,
   heuristic evidence without a fresh tape co-sign (SPY <= -1.5%, VIX +10%, or
   a same-session term inversion) reads one severity rung down:
   `confirmed_stress` -> watch, 3-red `panic` -> act. Pure-tape panic
   (SPY <= -4%/-7%) always reaches urgent. Promotion out of `pending_backtest`
   happens per versioned threshold-set label via the backtest plan.
2. If a confirming cluster's source health is stale/partial/degraded, severity
   caps at watch (evidence-keyed: an unrelated dead feed does not mute a fresh
   confirmation).

Closed-date tape gating (2026-07-19): every lifecycle term that reads the
direct SPY/VIX day-change prints requires an official trading date. The
daemon stamps `tape_session_state` (embedded NYSE calendar) on each regime
snapshot and journals it as `tape_session`; the backtest replay stamps the
same classification from the observation clock. On closed dates (weekend or
holiday) frozen last-session prints cannot enter or hold `panic`,
`confirmed_stress`, `early_warning`, `opportunity`, or `stabilization`,
cannot co-sign heuristic confirmation (the term-inversion co-sign keeps its
own status gate), and cannot claim the pure-tape panic severity exemption;
the tape evidence rows keep the frozen print's magnitude but read
forward-warning / observe / unconfirmed. Cluster-driven terms are untouched,
so real cluster reds still warn and confirm on any date. Weekday
pre/post/overnight prints keep full effect (they are live), and dates outside
embedded calendar coverage leave the state empty so tape terms fail open. The
trading rulebook's regime-stage latch skips closed-date snapshots: the last
trading-date stage governs weekend rule thresholds through the existing
carried worse-of path instead of a frozen-print or cluster-only weekend stage
re-latching fresh.

Closed-date tape values (2026-07-19): the day-change numbers themselves are
pinned on those same dates. The gateway's last print and its tick-9
previous-close anchor can each reset independently while the market is closed
(the live Sunday exhibit read SPY +0.00% beside VIX +12.19% while Friday truly
closed SPY −0.99% / VIX +12.19% — a pair no market ever printed), so on
official non-trading dates the daemon computes `spy_change` / `spy_change_pct`
/ `vix_change_pct` from the official daily closes of the last two completed
sessions and names the span in `spy_change_basis` / `vix_change_basis`
("official closes 2026-07-16 → 2026-07-17 (weekend)"). Bars are matched by
exact official session date; when the closes cannot be resolved the change
fields are withheld (`fields_missing: spy_day_change` / `vix_day_change`)
rather than backfilled from drifted snapshots. Price ticks, the VIX/VIX3M
ratio, and banding inputs are unchanged — only the day-change fields pin.

Display tone follows governed severity, not just stage: `confirmed_stress`
with `severity: watch` remains an amber/watch headline, preserving red for
act-grade stress and `risk_off` for full risk-off conditions. The condition
label still stays "Confirmed stress regime" so the evidence balance is not
watered down.

## Composite Logic

The headline label is a single wording table shared by `composite.verdict` and
`posture.label` (`rpc.RegimeHeadline`); CLI, MCP, and SPA render the served
string:

| Cluster state | Regime label |
| --- | --- |
| 0 red and 0-2 yellow | Normal regime |
| 0 red and 3+ yellow | Elevated stress watch |
| any visible red (eligible or provisional) below confirmation | Stress signal present |
| stage `confirmed_stress`/`panic` (2 eligible reds, or 1 + tape) | Confirmed stress regime |
| 3+ eligible red | Broad stress regime |
| all ranked clusters eligible red | Full risk-off conditions |

The output may also show raw indicator counts for transparency. Cluster counts
are the primary signal because related rows, such as VIX and VVIX, are not
fully independent votes; `cluster_eligible_red_count` and
`cluster_provisional_red_count` split the reds by confirmation eligibility.

Lifecycle is a second layer on top of the row and cluster evidence:

| Lifecycle stage | Broad-market meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `quiet` | Enough data is ranked and no material stress or recovery/opportunity evidence is present. |
| `early_warning` | Weak, isolated, provisional, or forward-looking evidence is visible, but eligible independent confirmation is not yet present. |
| `confirmed_stress` | At least two ELIGIBLE stress clusters, or one eligible cluster plus confirming SPY/VIX tape, are active. |
| `panic` | Three or more eligible stress clusters, or tape severe enough (SPY <= -4%/-7%) that the regime should be treated as acute. |
| `stabilization` | Stress evidence is easing, but this is not yet a deployable opportunity by itself. |
| `opportunity` | Constructive tape and low stress evidence are present; this is broad-market context only, not a trade instruction. |
| `data_quality` | Missing, stale, computing, or degraded inputs prevent a confident lifecycle read. |

The lifecycle layer must keep unconfirmed red evidence visible without letting
a single fragile or stale proxy dominate the trigger. `readiness` should be
`blocked` or degraded when critical source health is stale, partial,
computing, or degraded; the severity governor additionally caps the demanded
response when the CONFIRMING clusters themselves are impaired.

An unconfirmed HYG/SPY-only red or USD/JPY-only red remains visible in the row
details, but it is counted as yellow at the cluster level; the independence
rescue that waives this downgrade counts ELIGIBLE reds only, so two marginal
reds can no longer confirm each other.

The expanded Tier 1 backtest shows that isolated red equity-volatility clusters
are also the main source of repeated false alarms. They should not be deleted:
major stress often starts in volatility before credit, funding, or FX confirms.
The live rule therefore keeps VIX/VIX3M inversion as stress, but downgrades an
isolated moderate VVIX-only red to yellow unless the already-visible SPY/VIX
tape or another cluster confirms it.

## Method Notes

Breadth is computed locally from S&P 500 constituent daily bars because the
retail IBKR feed does not provide the official S&P breadth series directly. The
daemon caches the post-close result; reads should not trigger a 500-name fanout.

Dealer gamma is an SPX/SPXW-canonical zero-gamma estimate from IBKR option
chain data, with SPY used as additive context when usable. The live sweep uses
the nearest 80 listed strikes per expiry inside the +/-10% candidate window to
keep the IBKR fan-out bounded, especially for SPX/SPXW. Historical backtests
should exclude gamma unless the row has a trusted point-in-time gamma snapshot
with method, source, coverage, and timestamp.

Open interest is a required input for OI-weighted dealer GEX, but missing OI is
unknown, never zero. Priced legs without observed OI may still fit the IV/skew
surface, but they must be omitted from OI-weighted GEX and surfaced through
`warning_details` / `data_quality`. SPY option OI can be absent outside regular
U.S. option hours. SPX option OI should normally be stable across session
phases; missing SPX OI is unexpected data-quality evidence even pre-market,
after-hours, overnight, or on closed-session cache reads.

MOVE/rates-vol is outside the live surface until a verified IBKR contract or
licensed official connector exists. Do not proxy it with ETFs or futures.

## Decisions Journal

Every decision-relevant regime snapshot appends one line to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/ibkr/regime-decisions.jsonl`: raw values, bands, depth
metrics, streaks, freshness, eligibility, cluster tallies, lifecycle decision,
and governor records. Lines dedupe on the snapshot's semantic fingerprint with
an hourly heartbeat. The file is append-only, never read at runtime, and safe
to delete, the same contract as `gamma-skew-diagnostics.jsonl`. It is the
forward-collection corpus that makes the `pending_backtest` thresholds
calibratable: a threshold set drops `pending_backtest` only with months of
journal coverage, measured false-alarm/recall rates against labeled episodes,
and a version-label bump documented here. Disable via
`ibkr settings set regime.journal.enabled=false`.

## Backtesting

The active backtest sequence, tuning gates, and source-data backlog live in
[Regime and Canary Backtest Runbook](regime-backtest-plan.md). Keep this file
as the product contract for `ibkr regime`; do not use it as a second tuning
backlog.
