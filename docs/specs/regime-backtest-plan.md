# Regime and Canary Backtest Runbook

**Updated:** 2026-06-04 07:42 CEST

This is the single umbrella for proving and tuning `ibkr regime` and
`ibkr canary`. Keep the work here. Do not add another experiment plan, tuning
plan, or backtest framework unless this runbook says to.

The goal is simple: prove that regime and canary produce useful stress
detection without overfitting to named events.

## Plain Definitions

- A panel is a JSONL table: one row per date, using only information that would
  have been known on that date.
- A target label is for scoring only. It must not feed the signal.
- `regime` answers: what is the broad market state?
- `canary` answers: given account, positions, and regime, should the monitor
  stay quiet, watch, act, rebalance, flag opportunity, or block on data quality?
- Portfolio-only stress, including positions-only held-underlying stress,
  belongs to canary. Regime can keep those rows for context, but they are
  out-of-scope for market-regime precision and recall.

## Artifact Map

All backtest artifacts live in one of these places:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/specs/regime-backtest-plan.md` | This runbook: sequencing, gates, stop rules, and current backlog. |
| `docs/specs/risk-regime-dashboard.md` | Product contract for live `ibkr regime`; not a tuning backlog. |
| `scripts/backtest/` | Reproducible data-build and comparison scripts only. |
| `internal/cli/testdata/backtest_sources*.jsonl` | Source ledgers: URLs, checksums, gaps, and retrieval status. |
| `internal/cli/testdata/regime_pit_panel*.jsonl` | Point-in-time market rows consumed by `build-regime`. |
| `internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest*.jsonl` | Compact regime replay rows consumed by `backtest regime`. |
| `internal/cli/testdata/canary_backtest*.jsonl` | Canary replay rows with account and position overlays. |

Do not hand-edit generated compact regime rows when the point-in-time panel is
the source of truth. Rebuild them.

## Command Sequence

Small smoke fixtures:

```bash
ibkr backtest regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest_sample.jsonl
ibkr backtest canary --input internal/cli/testdata/canary_backtest_sample.jsonl
```

Curated sourced fixtures:

```bash
ibkr backtest regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest_sourced_tuning.jsonl
ibkr backtest canary --input internal/cli/testdata/canary_backtest_sourced_tuning.jsonl
ibkr backtest regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest_sourced_holdout.jsonl
ibkr backtest canary --input internal/cli/testdata/canary_backtest_sourced_holdout.jsonl
```

Point-in-time regime builder:

```bash
ibkr backtest build-regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_pit_panel_sample.jsonl \
  > /tmp/regime_backtest_rows.jsonl
ibkr backtest regime --input /tmp/regime_backtest_rows.jsonl
```

That is two passes only when starting from raw point-in-time market rows. If the
input is already compact regime JSONL, run `ibkr backtest regime` directly.

Tier 1 expanded panel:

```bash
python3 scripts/backtest/build-tier1-regime-panel.py --no-fetch
ibkr backtest build-regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_pit_panel_tier1.jsonl \
  > internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest_tier1.jsonl
ibkr backtest regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_backtest_tier1.jsonl
python3 scripts/backtest/compare-tier1-vol-rules.py
```

## Data Tiers

Tier 0: smoke fixtures.

- Purpose: keep CLI contracts stable.
- Gate: tiny samples continue to run and render.

Tier 1: expanded volatility/calm/event panel.

- Sources: Cboe VIX/VIX3M/VVIX, Nasdaq ETF OHLC, FRED funding/FX/credit where
  available.
- Current artifact: `regime_pit_panel_tier1.jsonl`.
- Source ledger: `backtest_sources_tier1.jsonl`.
- Primary label: 5-session market stress.
- Secondary feature: 20-session drawdown for early-warning analysis.
- Known gap: gamma and breadth are explicitly unavailable.

Tier 2: confirmation proxy panel.

- Purpose: test whether noisy isolated red volatility can be confirmed or
  downgraded without losing major stress events.
- Allowed sources: reproducible public or IBKR/Nasdaq/FRED daily data.
- Candidate proxies: `RSP/SPY`, `IWM/SPY`, `QQQE/QQQ` or `QQQ/SPY`,
  `HYG/LQD`, `HYG/IEF`, `LQD/TLT`, `TLT/IEF`, `SHY/IEF`, and FRED rates/curve
  series.
- Label these as proxies. They are not official S&P 500 breadth, official MOVE,
  or reconstructed gamma.
- `LQD/TLT` is context-only for now because it mixes credit spread, duration,
  and rates effects. Do not use it as an active confirmation input.

### Tier 2 Input Classification

The Tier 2 inputs are not all product indicators. This is the final
classification for the current pass:

| Series | Classification | Runtime decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RSP/SPY` | Historical proxy for missing breadth/participation. | Do not promote. Live `ibkr regime` already has first-class constituent breadth. |
| `QQQE/QQQ` | Historical proxy for Nasdaq mega-cap concentration/participation. | Do not promote into broad regime. Keep as backtest context unless a separate concentration surface is designed. |
| `IWM/SPY` | Context-only risk appetite/size rotation. | Do not promote; it is not S&P breadth and can fire during benign leadership shifts. |
| `HYG/LQD`, `HYG/IEF` | Historical credit-confirmation proxies. | Do not promote now. Runtime already exposes HYG/SPY and official HY OAS; add another live credit ETF row only if HY OAS proves persistently unavailable. |
| `LQD/TLT` | Context-only. | Excluded from active confirmation because it mixes credit, duration, and rates effects. |
| `TLT/IEF`, `SHY/IEF` | Context-only rates/duration stress proxies. | Do not promote; they are not MOVE/rates vol and produced calm/rally false alarms. |
| FRED rates/curve series | Context or source-data support. | Do not promote as new regime indicators without a separate product definition and point-in-time source gate. |

No Tier 2 ETF proxy is promoted into live `ibkr regime` in this pass. The
production change is narrower: isolated red `VVIX` is treated as an
unconfirmed equity-volatility warning unless severity or already-visible tape
confirms it. The red row remains visible in `ibkr regime`; only the cluster vote
is downgraded from stress to watch.

## Current Findings

- Curated sourced regime holdout materially improves confirmed-stress precision
  while preserving watch-level visibility: before 67% precision / 100% recall /
  13% false alarms, after 100% precision / 100% recall / 0% false alarms.
- Curated sourced regime tuning improves precision from 68% to 75% and false
  alarms from 32% to 21%; recall falls from 93% to 86%, which is a monitoring
  item but not a collapse.
- Curated canary holdout catches labelled stress at watch level: watch
  precision 73%, recall 100%; act precision 86%, recall 75%, false alarms 6%.
- Canary adds portfolio-specific lift beyond regime alone: sourced holdout
  portfolio-stress recall moves from 75% regime-only to 100% canary, with one
  additional portfolio true positive.
- Canary action/readiness metrics are now first-class: watch recall of later
  confirmed stress is 100% on the sourced holdout, median lead is 1.0 day,
  and action buckets are tracked separately from the stateless canary JSON
  surface.
- Category reporting is split for market-driven, portfolio-driven,
  concentration-driven, margin-driven, options-driven, and data-quality cases;
  held-underlying P&L shock maps to concentration-driven, near-expiry held-option
  delta maps to options-driven, and held-liquidity degradation maps to
  data-quality. Current sourced holdout has no options-driven rows, so that
  slice is instrumented but not yet proven.
- Tier 1 exposes the broader problem: current `any red cluster` stress signals
  catch stress rows but fire too often in non-stress volatility regimes.
- A pure confirmation rule cuts false alarms but gives up too much recall.
- Therefore the next tuning target is narrow: isolated red volatility.
- Tier 2 source access is usable for a bounded proxy pass. The current build
  fetched all required Nasdaq ETF histories and recorded checksums. The first
  14 rows have unavailable proxy windows because the 20-session lookback is not
  mature yet.
- Tier 2 stress-label scoring moves the current holdout baseline out of the
  10.8% Tier 1 forward-label noise zone: current `any red cluster` is 34.2%
  precision and 69.1% recall on the 2024+ observable-stress target.
- The best tested Tier 2 confirmation rule improves holdout stress precision to
  45.1% and cuts false alarms from 17.2% to 9.2%, but recall falls to 58.2%.
- This remains a diagnostic proxy result, not a production rule, because it
  relies on ETF proxy groups that are not live regime indicators.
- The promoted runtime-visible severity split improves Tier 2 holdout stress
  precision from 34.2% to 43.9%, keeps recall at 65.5% versus the 69.1%
  current baseline, and cuts false alarms from 17.2% to 10.8%.
- Tier 1 primary holdout, which is intentionally noisy forward-label scoring,
  improves from 10.8% precision / 66.7% recall / 21.5% false alarms to 14.6% /
  66.7% / 15.2%.

## Next Pass

Run this sequence and stop at the first failed gate:

1. Validate Tier 2 proxy sources and record them in the source ledger.
2. Build a Tier 2 point-in-time panel by extending Tier 1 with confirmation
   proxy features.
3. Split labels into:
   - `watch`: early warning / elevated risk.
   - `stress`: observable market damage or strongly confirmed broad stress.
4. Compare exactly three stress-signal rules:
   - current: any red cluster is stress.
   - confirmation-only: isolated red volatility is not stress.
   - severity split: isolated red volatility is watch unless severity or
     independent confirmation is strong enough.
5. Tune only the severity split, and only on the tuning split.
6. Score holdout once the tuning behavior is stable.

Final promoted rule:

- Keep red indicator rows visible.
- Keep VIX/VIX3M backwardation as stress-level equity volatility.
- Treat isolated `VVIX` red as stress only when `VVIX >= 120`, VIX is up at
  least 20% on the day, SPY is down at least 1% on the day, or another
  independent cluster is red.
- Otherwise count the equity-volatility cluster as yellow while leaving the
  `VVIX` row red and auditable.
- Do not use Tier 2 ETF proxy groups in runtime behavior until they are
  promoted into the live contract.

## Data Gates

Tier 2 data is green only if all are true:

- Every proxy has a reproducible source, retrieval status, and checksum.
- Missing data stays unavailable; no fabricated green/yellow/red values.
- The source ledger names every source gap plainly.
- Gamma remains excluded unless a method-stamped point-in-time source exists.
- Official S&P 500 breadth and MOVE are excluded unless a clean licensed or
  public source is proven.
- The point-in-time panel can rebuild the compact replay file deterministically.

If these fail, do not tune. Fix data or stop.

## Tuning Gates

A tuning change is allowed only if all are true:

- Watch recall remains high on major broad-market stress events.
- Stress precision materially beats the Tier 1 holdout baseline of 10.8%.
- Stress recall does not collapse on holdout.
- Major events are not hidden: Volmageddon, COVID, 2022 bear-market stress,
  yen carry unwind, and tariff shock remain visible at least at watch level.
- Calm/rally controls get quieter or the remaining false alarms are explainable.
- Portfolio-only stress is evaluated by canary, not counted as regime failure.
- Data-quality warnings are separate from stress false positives.

If Tier 2 cannot materially improve precision without destroying recall, stop
tuning and revisit the product definition. Do not add more indicators just to
force convergence.

## Verification Gates

Before calling a pass done:

```bash
make check
make smoke
```

After CLI or daemon changes, also install and smoke the actual binary:

```bash
make restart-daemon
ibkr status
ibkr backtest build-regime --input internal/cli/testdata/regime_pit_panel_sample.jsonl \
  > /tmp/ibkr-build-regime-smoke.jsonl
ibkr backtest regime --input /tmp/ibkr-build-regime-smoke.jsonl
```

## Not Doing

- No forecast probabilities.
- No learned cluster weights.
- No automated experiment store.
- No combined `backtest loop` command.
- No gamma reconstruction from current or later data.
- No official S&P 500 breadth without point-in-time constituent coverage.
- No MOVE/rates-vol input without a clean source.
