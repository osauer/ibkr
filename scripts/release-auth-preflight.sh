# release-auth-preflight.sh - fail-fast auth checks before the release
# pipeline spends ~10 minutes on gates. What can actually be verified at
# minute 0:
#   - gh CLI auth (release-publish creates the GitHub Release page); goes
#     stale between releases and used to surface only at the last legs.
#   - The registry leg's local fallback preconditions. The normal release path
#     waits for the registry-publish Actions workflow to publish via OIDC. If
#     that workflow does not deliver, registry-publish-with-login.sh is the
#     backstop. Its GitHub device-code JWTs live only ~5 minutes (observed
#     v2.1.0, 2026-07-18; originally assumed hours), so refreshing one here is
#     meaningless. This preflight verifies that fallback is armed (publisher
#     binary present, MCP_REGISTRY_AUTO_LOGIN not disabled); the operator needs
#     a browser only if the OIDC workflow fails.
