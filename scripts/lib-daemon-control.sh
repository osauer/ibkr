#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lib-daemon-control.sh — shared helpers for the smoke scripts to spin
# up an isolated `ibkr daemon` under /tmp without colliding with the
# user's canonical daemon. Sourced by release-verify.sh and
# wire-smoke.sh.
#
# Provides:
#   stop_existing_daemons <label>
#       SIGTERM (with SIGKILL fallback) every running `ibkr daemon`
#       process. The IBKR gateway accepts one connection per client ID,
#       so running two daemons with the same ID makes the second fail
#       with "code 326 / client id already in use" — this aborted the
#       v0.16.0 release on first run before the workaround was added.
#       Survivors auto-spawn on the next CLI call, so the cost is one
#       bounce. <label> is the prefix for the user-facing banner
#       ("release-verify", "wire-smoke", …).
#
#   kill_daemon_from_lockfile <lockfile>
#       SIGTERM the daemon whose PID is recorded in <lockfile>; wait up
#       to 3s for graceful exit; SIGKILL stragglers. Silent no-op when
#       the lockfile is unreadable (daemon already exited cleanly).

    # request can respawn the daemon mid-kill) makes this race common
    # rather than rare; 5s is conservative — TWS typically clears in
    # 1-2s but a busy gateway can stretch it.
